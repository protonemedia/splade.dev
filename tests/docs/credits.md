# Credits

First, I want to thank [Patricio](https://twitter.com/ijpatricio) for reaching out and showing me the idea of mixing Blade and Vue components. I've worked with renderless templates in Vue 2, but it absolutely blew my mind when he demoed the *Render*-component. He was generous enough to find time for a brainstorming call and elaborate his thoughts on it.

I'm a *massive* fan of [Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com), and tons of Splade features and implementations were copied or inspired by Inertia.js. So a huge thanks to [Jonathan](https://twitter.com/reinink) and [Claudio](https://twitter.com/claudiodekker) for coming up with the idea and maintaining the project.

Then I'd like to thank [Caleb](https://twitter.com/calebporzio) for his work on [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), a modern, minimal JavaScript framework. You'll also find that some patterns were hugely inspired by it. Two other projects I should mention are [Wire Elements](https://wire-elements.dev) by [Philo](https://twitter.com/Philo01) and [Momentum Modal](https://github.com/lepikhinb/momentum-modal) by [Boris](https://twitter.com/lepikhinb/). Both were tremendously helpful while implementing the Modal feature in Splade.

And lastly, I need to thank [Taylor](https://twitter.com/taylorotwell) and the rest of the [Laravel team](https://laravel.com/team) for bringing us the best web application framework we've ever seen. To make Splade look familiar to developers, I've based most of the frontend-boilerplate on [Jetsteam](https://jetstream.laravel.com/2.x/introduction.html).

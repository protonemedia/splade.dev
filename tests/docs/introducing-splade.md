# Introducing Splade

Splade provides a **super easy** way to build *Single Page Applications* (SPA) using standard [Laravel Blade](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/blade) templates, enhanced with [renderless Vue 3 components](https://adamwathan.me/renderless-components-in-vuejs/). In essence, you can write your app using the simplicity of Blade, and besides that magic *SPA-feeling*, you can sparkle it to make it interactive. All without ever leaving Blade.

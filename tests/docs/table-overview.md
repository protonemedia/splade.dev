# Table (DataTables) Component

[Splade](/introducing-splade.md) has an advanced Table component that supports auto-fill, searching, filtering, sorting, toggling columns, and pagination. You may also perform bulk actions and exports. Though optional, it integrates beautifully with Spatie's [Laravel Query Builder](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-query-builder).

*This video is from a previous Splade version that did not have the built-in Query Builder yet. An updated instruction video will soon replace it!*
